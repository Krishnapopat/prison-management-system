# prison-management-system
Developed a comprehensive prison management system in C-language to store prisonerâ€™s data, including their IDs, names, and
more. The system features functions for adding, deleting, and editing prisoner records. Additionally, we implemented file
handling functionality to store the data in a separate file, ensuring seamless data management.
